# Crime Rate Detector
This Model is 71.9% accurate
As the name suggests, this Computer Science project involves building a prediction model that can analyze and predict the crime rate of a particular location. Naturally, the system needs to be fed with relevant data. It uses the MLPRegressor algorithm which stands for Multilayer perceptron Regressor to predict the crime rate. Reported number by detecting relevant crime patterns via hidden links, link prediction, and statistical analysis of crime data.
